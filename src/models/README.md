# Pretrained models

This folder has been taken from the original paper repository. It can be found [here](https://github.com/ZiangYan/subspace-attack.pytorch/tree/master/models).

Almost no file has not been modified. The only edit we made is to change the class name of the different VGG models used.

Moreover, we have only implemented our own way to load pretrained models, instead of the one used in the original repository.
