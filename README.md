# Subspace Attack Reproduction

Attempt to reproduce the NeurIPS 2019 paper [Subspace Attack: Exploiting Promising Subspaces for Query-Efficient Black-box Attacks](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/8638-subspace-attack-exploiting-promising-subspaces-for-query-efficient-black-box-attacks).

The original code of the paper can be found [here](https://github.com/ZiangYan/subspace-attack.pytorch). We are trying to reproduce the attack to GDAS model trained on CIFAR-10 dataset, without using and looking at the original code.

This project is done as project for the [CS-433 Machine Learning Course](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/mlo/machine-learning-cs-433/) at [EPFL](https://epfl.ch/en), and as part of the [NeurIPS 2019 Reproducibility Challenge](https://reproducibility-challenge.github.io/neurips2019/).
